# Image-Classification

• OBJECTIVE:
Developed a face recognition system to accurately detect and distinguish among five individuals.

• APPROACH:
       Utilized Python’s OpenCV for facial detection and recognition, applying Haar Cascade Classifier to capture detailed facial features
(shape, color, layout) and wavelet transformations for edge and texture analysis. Conducted thorough data preprocessing and feature
extraction, optimizing model robustness and accuracy for personalized image recognition.

• TOOLS and TECHNIQUES: 
          Python
          Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
          Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
          Sklearn for model building
          Jupyter notebook and pycharm as IDE
          Python flask for http server
          HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
